Here’s the deal for this weekend and a peek at the next few days:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>This afternoon:</strong> Partly sunny, a bit blustery (up to 15 mph NNW), and highs touching 62°F. \n            <li><strong>Sunday:</strong> Mostly sunny, high around 63°F, northwesterly breeze staying steady. \n            <li><strong>Monday & Tuesday:</strong> Still mild, partly to mostly cloudy, highs near 60–62°F. \n        </ul>\n        <p>\n        This is pretty prime fishing weather — the lack of blasting sunshine means predators are comfortable cruising. Wind can stack baitfish on certain banks, so pick your side based on the breeze. Bring extra layers for chilly, foggy mornings; the sun will eventually show up and burn it all off.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class="section">\n        <h2>Water Conditions</h2>\n        <p>\n        Delta temps are running mid 60s (64-66°F), which is perfect for both stripers and bass to be active. Water clarity is quite good for this time of fall, with most central Delta spots showing 4–6 feet of visibility. A little fresh debris and weed-clumps are floating around, thanks to rainfall and some dam releases, but that’s actually improving overall water quality and cleaning things out.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        If you want the best action and less frustration, avoid areas overloaded with floating green stuff. Stick to main channels and points where the current is moving through, but skip places where the outgoing flush dumps mud and trash — you’ll find clearer water on the main stem and island edges.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class="section">\n        <h2>Striper Scene</h2>\n        <p>\n            Striped bass are making their appearance in catchable numbers across the central Delta — especially around Frank’s Tract and the area between Prisoner’s Point and Ladd’s. Most fish are the fun-size schoolies (15–22 inchers), though an occasional brute will show itself. The big fish haven’t totally stacked up yet, but expect a push as more fish move upriver on the coming moon and falling temps.\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Best bite zones:</strong> Flats in 3–6 feet of water, island points, and anywhere rock meets moving water. Cover-water is key — don’t park too long anywhere.</li>\n            <li><strong>Most consistent techniques:</strong> \n                <ul>\n                    <li>Suspending <a class="lure-link" href="https://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Lucky_Craft_Pointer_100SP_Jerkbait/descpage-LCP100.html" target="_blank">jerkbaits</a> ( silver/white or chrome shad colors rock right now)</li>\n                    <li>White <a class="lure-link" href="https://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Z-Man_ChatterBait_Elite/descpage-ZMICE.html" target="_blank">chatterbaits</a> fished steadily</li>\n                    <li><a class="lure-link" href="https://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Strike_King_KVD_Swim_N_Shiner_Swimbait_7pk/descpage-KVS.html" target="_blank">Soft jerkbaits (flukes)</a> for random big bites</li>\n                    <li>Topwater walking baits and big glidebaits can tempt a better grade, especially early or during overcast, but they’re hit or miss</li>\n                </ul>\n            </li>\n            <li><strong>Bait guys:</strong> Drifting live bluegill works if you can get 'em, but panfish are harder to find shallow. Consider cutting baits if you strike out on live ones.</li>\n            <li><strong>Tides:</strong> Fish are responding best on the incoming and outgoing, just avoid dead low unless you see birds and bait active.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>\n            Bonus tip: If a spot looks dead, don’t be afraid to bounce quick and find active fish.
